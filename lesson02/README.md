# Lesson 02
### Functional Programming 3

## Assignments & Exercises
* Generators and Closures

## Learning Objectives
1. define a closure as a factory for creating stand-alone methods.
2. describe the arity of a function.
3. curry a function to reduce its arity, its number of arguments in particular, and thereby make it suitable for functional composition.
4. use the Itertools library.
5. use the Functools library.
