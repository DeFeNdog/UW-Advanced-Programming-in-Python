## Learning Objectives
* Apply data definition techniques to help assure the quality of the data your Python programs use.
* Store and retrieve single and multiple sets of records in a database from your Python programs so that you can leverage data management services from a database.
* Use simple techniques to help model data correctly in a relational database, and recognize the tradeoffs between different options for this.

### Required Reading
* [Relational database concepts](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sql/sql-rdbms-concepts.htm)
* [The Peewee Quickstart](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/quickstart.html)
* [Query examples](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/query_examples.html)
* [Peewee models](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/models.html)

### Supplemental Reading
* [How to interact with sqlite from Python (does not use Peewee)](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_sqlite_in_python_tutorial.html)
* A great reference book for SQL that shows details of SQL for several databases is "SQL in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference Guide"
* If you really want to understand the details of SQL, then this is an excellent book: "Joe Celko's SQL Programming Style (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)"
* Data model design is a complex topic that requires lots of knowledge. If you do a lot of database work then the three books in the series "The Data Model Resource Book" (Vol. 1, 2 and 3) are invaluable.nks to an external site.
